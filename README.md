# practice_iceskating

### Ice-Skating site just to train some basic stuff with HTML and CSS.

My first Git repository where I try to learn as much basic stuff as possible to be able to understand how to correctly use **Git/Github**.
Mostly using *HTML/CSS* but I'll try and put some *Javascript* as I explore the possibilities.
